  "summary": "Das's attack on the \nvires of the Act mainly rests on the contention that it \nis implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II \nof the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that pro-\nperty could not be acquired without payment of com-\npensation, the only effect of a compulsory power of \nacquisition against the individual being that there is \nthe power to oblige him to sell and convey property \nwhen the public necessities require it, but that the \npower to take compulsorily raises by implication a \nright to payment ; in other words, there is a con-\ncomitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire \nis inseparable from the obligation to pay compen-\nsation and as the provisions of the statute in respect \nof payment of compensation are illusory, it is uncon-\nstitutional II \nof Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, at page 744, \nwherein it is said as follows :-\n\"The purpose must be public, and must have \nreference to the needs or convenience of the public, \nand no reason of general pnblic policy will be sufficient \nto validate other transfers when they concern existing \nvested rights.\" \nFinally, it was urged tl1at there was nothing definite \nor tangible in the Act or in the views of the legisla-\ntures which gave any indication of the public purpose \nfor which the estates were being acquired and all that \ncould be gathered was that the legislature did not \nknow its own mind at all and on a vague notion of some \nfuture policy directed the acquisition of the estates \nThe entry reads tfius:-\n\"Principles on which compensation for property \nacquired or requisitioned for purposes of the Union or \nof a State or for any other public purpose is to be \ndetermined, and the form and manner in which such \ncompensation is to be given.\" \nThis head of legislation seems to have been expressly \nmentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of \nthe accepted principle of law that in cases of compul-\nsory acquisition of property compensation has to be \nmade but also in view of the clear and mandatory \nprovisions of article 31(2) which require that a law \nauthorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will \nbe void if it does not provide for payment of compen-\nsation for the property acquired or does not either fix \nthe amount of compensation or specify the principles \non which and the manner in which the compensation \nis to be determined and given This \nlegislative power of Parliament or of the State Legis-\nlatures is, by article 245, made \"subject to the provi-\nsions of this Constitution.\" One of the provil;ions 0f \nthe Constitution is article 31 (2) under which no pro-\nperty can be \"taken possession of or acquired for \npublic purposes under any law authorising the taking \nof such possession or such acquisition unless the law \nprovides for compensation for the property and either \nfixes the amount of compensation or specifies the \nprinciples on which, and the mam:1er in which, the \ncompensation is to be determined and given.\" The \nscheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the \nthree things separately, namely, the power of making a \nlaw for acquisition of property in article 246 read \nwith entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, the \nobligation of such law to provide for compensation in \narticle 31 (2) and the power of making a law laying \ndown the · principles for determining such compen-\nsation in article 246 read with entry 42 in List III That the \nAct has no public purpose to support it is sought to be \nestablished by saying that ln Bihar the recorded pro-\nprietors are about 13,35,919 in number and that \nassuming that there are four persons in a family, \nnearly five and a half million people will be ruined \nas a result of this legislation, although the actual tillers \nof the soil will derive no benefit whatever therefrom, \nfor they will remain where they are and will have to \ncontinue, as heretofore, to pay rJ.eir rent, instead of to \ntheir present landlords, to the ~tate which, they will \nfind, is no better than a ruthless machine unsusceptible \nto any humane feeling If the acquisition of th~ \nzamindaries and the tenures is, as I hold, dictated or \ninspired by the sound public purpose of ameliorating \nthe economic and political conditions of the actual \ntenants, the self same public purpose may well require \nthe acquisition of the arrears of rent so as to avert the \nundesirable but inevitable consequences I have men-\ntioned The Bihar Legislature obviouslly thought \nthat the tenants in arears will have better treatment \nand a more reasonable accommodation, in the matter \nof the liquidation of the huge arrears, from the State \nwhich will act under the guidance of the Land Com-\nmission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole \nsurviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only \nbe to realise as much of the arrears as they can from \nthe tenants and within the shortest possible time \nwithout any mercy or accommodation if it sees fit to do so, but it \nis not likely that it will be found disregarding it, \nwithout plain expres1sions of such a purpose.\" \nThis principle is embodied in article 31 (2) of our \nConstitution in these terms :-\n\"~o prop_erty, i:iovable or immovaJ:le, including \nany mterest m, or m any company ownmg, any com-\nmercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos-\nsession of or acquired for public purposes under any \nlaw authorising the taking of such possession or such \nacquisition, unless the law provides for compensation \nfor the property taken possession of or acquired and \neither fixes the amount of the compensation, or \nspecifies the principles on which, and the manner in \nwhich, the compensation JS to be determined and \ngiven.\" \nWe shall not here trouble ourselves with sub-clauses \n(3) and (4) of the article and with articles 31-A and \n31-B which were introduced by way of amendment \nunder the Constitution First Amendment Act, 1951, \ndated 18-6-1951",
